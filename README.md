# Personal entry to Sebastial Lague's Chess Coding Challenge

All of the rules and information about the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge).

The only thing changed in this repository for the competition is Chess-Challenge/src/My Bot/MyBot.cs.

If you want to play against my bot, follow the instructions in the 'How To Participate' section of the README for the original repository (accessible from the link above) to launch the program, then select the 'Human vs MyBot' option in the top left.
